<p class="proj-info"><strong>Role:</strong> UX Researcher and UI Designer <br>

<div class="proj-1">
<p>Created a mobile application for WokWorks, a food truck chain around Philadelphia serving Asian halal food. 
    WokWorks is known for its extremely customizable menu and its friendly staff. We strived to create an app that 
    showcases these features through personal touches that mimic the WokWorks experience.

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p class="proj-info"> WokWorks is known for their friendly and welcoming customer service. Many of their customers became 
        regulars due to personal connections the owner and staff had made with them out of kindness. <br>

        Our main challenge was bringing the friendliness and fun back into the WokWorks ordering process to restore the welcoming experience that customers adore. </p> 
    </div>
    <div class="proj-intro">
    <h2> Research </h2>
    <p class="proj-info">When preparing to begin the structure and design of our app, we knew we needed to construct a 
        clearer picture of WokWorks as a company and a brand, as well as gain information about their customers. 

       <br> The next step was to visit the physical location and dive deep into analyzing the business 
       and consumer-sides of WokWorks. This stage of research included a SWOT analysis, the Four Cs and  empathy mapping.

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p class="proj-info"> We moved onto Fly-On-The-Wall tests to better understand the users behavior and their interactions with the truck. 
        Then, we conducted user interviews which gave us insight into target customer's thoughts about WokWorks and what 
        they would want out of a mobile ordering process. From this information, we created our user persona.</p>

            <p class="hi-fi"> After 2 rounds of usability testing we refined our designs. Through this, we achieved our goal, and converted 
                the in-person ordering process to a digital experience right at your fingertips, layered with personalization and 
                ample customization opportunities. We added a build your bowl animation as well an order confirmation animation  that 
                our users loved accompanied with a minimalistic design that made the app user freindly.</p>
